<br/>
<p>      This course is designed for graduate students to <strong>learn how to conduct HCI research</strong>. You will <em>learn to formulate problems into research questions, to do a literature review, to design and conduct experiments. You will read, present, and discuss state-of-art and classic papers</em>. And ultimately, <em>you will conduct an HCI research project to solve a usability problem as a team and write an HCI paper</em>.
        </p>
<p> <strong>This was previously CS6501: Special Topics in Human-Computer Interaction and just given a permanent course number assigned. If you have taken that course, you do not need to take this course. </strong>

<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p><strong>The best way to learn to conduct research is to do it.</strong>Therefore, in this course, you will do the following activities that are essential in HCI research:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reading responses: </strong>Knowing literature is the key in research! 
                  You will read a research paper and write a two-paragraph reading response each week. The reading response will include 1) summary of the paper and 2) your reaction to the paper.
                    <br/> I understand there are rainy days, so two lowest-grade reading responses will not count towards your grade.</li>
<li><strong>Assignment: </strong>You will learn to design and conduct experiments, and you'll try yourself one as an assignment. </li>
<li><strong>Quizzes: </strong>There will be three simple quizzes so that you can remind yourself about what you've learned in the class. </li>
<li><strong>Summary presentation: </strong>Once a semester, you will give a 5-minute presentation about a paper before in-class paper discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Course project: </strong>This is the essense of this course. You will conduct an HCI project as a team. 
                  Each team will 1) find a research topic on building an interactive system that solves a usability problem, 2) do a literature review on the topic, 3) design and implement the system, and 4) evaluate the system. It is encouraged to connect your research to the course project.
                </li>
</ul>
<p>While this course welcomes students with a diverse background, you should be able to write code for successful completion of the project.
            </p>

<h2 id="ia-AI-policy">Use of GenAI in This Course</h2>
<p>
          You may use AI for getting help with reports and assignments. There are two requirements: 
          <ul>
<li>You take the full responsibility on whatever is on your submission. If there are false information caused by AI hallucination, it will be on you.</li>
<li>Write how you used AI in your report, along with prompts you used. For example, "I used ChatGPT to turn my long writing into a single-paragraph summary." or, "I used Google Gemini to check for grammar", "We used Google Stitch to create the user interface of our project system."</li>
</ul>
          If you fail to meet any of the two requirements above, you will get 0 for that assignment. 
        </p>
<h2 id="ia-students-with-disabilities-or-learning-needs">Students with disabilities or learning needs</h2>
<p>
It is my goal to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with me outside of class so we can explore potential options. Students with disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this course, including official accommodations. We are fortunate to have an SDAC advisor, Courtney MacMasters, physically located in Engineering. You may email her at cmacmasters@virginia.edu to schedule an appointment. For general questions please visit the SDAC website: <a href="https://sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu">https://sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu</a>. If you have already been approved for accommodations through SDAC, please send me your accommodation letter and meet with me so we can develop an implementation plan together.
</p>

<h2 id="ia-discrimination-and-power-based-violence">Discrimination and power-based violence</h2>
<p>The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. To that end, it is vital that you know two values that I and the University hold as critically important:</p>
<ol>
<li>Power-based personal violence will not be tolerated.</li>
<li>Everyone has a responsibility to do their part to maintain a safe community on Grounds.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence website that describes reporting options and resources available - <a href="www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence">www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence</a>.</p>
<p>As your professor and as a person, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as I can. As a faculty member, I am a responsible employee, which means that I am required by University policy and federal law to report what you tell me to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also reviewing the information presented to determine whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. If you wish to report something that you have seen, you can do so at the <strong>Just Report It</strong> portal (<a href="http://justreportit.virginia.edu/">http://justreportit.virginia.edu/</a>). <strong>The worst possible situation would be for you or your friend to remain silent when there are so many here willing and able to help.</strong></p>
<h2 id="ia-religious-accommodations">Religious accommodations</h2>
<p>It is the University's long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements.</p>
<p>Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request in writing directly to me as far in advance as possible. Students who have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact the University’s <a href="https://eocr.virginia.edu/"> Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR)</a> at <a href="mailto:UVAEOCR@virginia.edu">UVAEOCR@virginia.edu</a> or 434-924-3200.</p>
<h2 id="ia-harassment">Harassment, Discrimination, and Interpersonal Violence</h2>
<p>
  The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence website that describes reporting options and resources available - <a href="https://www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence">www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence</a>.</p>

  <p>
The same resources and options for individuals who experience sexual misconduct are available for discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.  UVA prohibits discrimination and harassment based on age, color, disability, family medical or genetic information, gender identity or expression, marital status, military status, national or ethnic origin, political affiliation, pregnancy (including childbirth and related conditions), race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status. UVA policy also prohibits retaliation for reporting such behavior. </p>

<p>
If you witness or are aware of someone who has experienced prohibited conduct, you are encouraged to submit a report to Just Report It (justreportit.virginia.edu) or contact EOCR, the office of Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights.</p>

<p>
If you would prefer to disclose such conduct to a confidential resource where what you share is not reported to the University, you can turn to Counseling & Psychological Services (“CAPS”) and Women’s Center Counseling Staff and Confidential Advocates (for students of all genders).  </p>

<p>
As your professor and as a person, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as I can. As a faculty member, I am a responsible employee, which means that I am required by University policy and by federal law to report certain kinds of conduct that you report to me to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also determining whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. 
</p>

<h2 id="ia-honor">Honor</h2>
<p>I trust every student in this course to fully comply with all of the provisions of the University’s Honor Code. By enrolling in this course, you have agreed to abide by and uphold the Honor System of the University of Virginia, as well as the following policies specific to this course.</p>
<ul>
<li>All graded assignments must be pledged.</li>
<li>All suspected violations will be forwarded to the Honor Committee, and you may, at my discretion, receive an immediate zero on that assignment regardless of any action taken by the Honor Committee.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please let me know if you have any questions regarding the course Honor policy. If you believe you may have committed an Honor Offense, you may wish to file a Conscientious Retraction by calling the Honor Offices at (434) 924-7602. For your retraction to be considered valid, it must, among other things, be filed with the Honor Committee before you are aware that the act in question has come under suspicion by anyone. More information can be found at <a href="http://honor.virginia.edu">http://honor.virginia.edu</a>. Your Honor representatives can be found at: <a href="http://honor.virginia.edu/representatives">http://honor.virginia.edu/representatives</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ia-career-development">Support for your career development</h2>
<p>
  Engaging in your career development is an important part of your student experience. For example, presenting at a research conference, attending an interview for a job or internship, or participating in an extern/shadowing experience are not only necessary steps on your path but are also invaluable lessons in and of themselves. I wish to encourage and support you in activities related to your career development. To that end, please notify me by email as far in advance as possible to arrange for appropriate accommodations.
</p>


<h2>Student support team</h2>
<p>
