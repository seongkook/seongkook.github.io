        <h2>Course Description</h2>
        <p><strong>The best way to learn to conduct research is to do it.</strong>Therefore, in this course, you will do the following activities that are essential in HCI research:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reading responses: </strong>Knowing the literature is the key! You will read a research paper and write a three-paragraph reading response each week. The reading response will include 1) summary of the paper and 2) your reaction to the paper.
                    <a href="HCI-R1.pdf">Example</a>.<br> I understand there are rainy days, so two lowest-grade reading responses will not count towards your grade.</li>
                <li><strong>Assignment: </strong>You will learn to design and conduct experiments, and you'll try yourself one as an assignment. </li>
                <li><strong>Quizzes: </strong>There will be four simple quizzes so that you can remind yourself about what you've learned in the class. </li>
                <li><strong>Summary presentation: </strong>Once a semester, you will give a 5-minute presentation about a paper before in-class paper discussion.</li>
                <li><strong>Course project: </strong>This is the essense of this course. You will conduct an HCI project as a team. 
                  Each team will 1) find a research topic on building an interactive system that solves a usability problem, 2) do a literature review on the topic, 3) design and implement the system, and 4) evaluate the system. It is encouraged to connect your research to the course project.
                </li>

            </ul>
            <p>While this course welcomes students with a diverse background, you should be able to write code for successful completion of the project.

        <h2>COVID-19 Policies FAQ</h2>
        <h3>Q: I am worried about the virus: will I know if there is an unvaccinated students in the class?</h3>        
        <p>
          In this message https://coronavirus.virginia.edu/updates/important-information-about-fall-2021, the University announced that all students who live, learn, or work in person at the University during the next academic year must be fully vaccinated before returning to Grounds unless they have obtained a medical or religious exemption from the University. Therefore, you can expect that students in your class are vaccinated. A very small number of students have received vaccination exemptions, so the likelihood that an unvaccinated student is in your class is slight.
        </p>

        <h3>Q: How will you accommodate a student who needs to isolate/quarantine?</h3>        
        <p>
          If a student informs us that they cannot attend class in-person because they have been requested to isolate or quarantine due to possible exposure to COVID-19, we will treat you as we would any other student absent due to illness. You will have access to the recordings of the lecture, either synchronously or asynchronously. 
        </p>

        <h3>Q: What if the Professor has to isolate/quarantine?</h3>        
        <p>
          If Prof. Heo has to isolate or quarantine, we may have virtual class sessions. 
        </p>

        <h3>Q: What if a TA has to iisolate/quarantine?</h3>        
        <p>
          If a TA has to isolate or quarantine, all TA office hours will be online, and Prof. Heo may take over the TA office hour (time many need to be adjusted).
        </p>
        
        <h3>Q: Are office hours going to be in-person or online?</h3>        
        <p>
          The default mode for office hours will be online, but in-person meetings are also possible upon request. Feel free to email the instructor or the TA. 
        </p>      

        <h3>Q: Do I have to wear a mask?</h3>        
        <p>
          Our class will diligently follow all University regulations in effect. If masks are required during a certain period, then they are absolutely required for class. If policy changes, then we will adjust accordingly. Failure to mask if a regulation is in effect will result in reporting to UJC and a professionalism penalty for the class.
        </p>
        
        
        <h2 id="ia-students-with-disabilities-or-learning-needs">Students with disabilities or learning needs</h2>
        <p>It is my goal to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with me outside of class so we can explore potential options. Students with disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability Access Center to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this course, including official accommodations. Please visit their website for information on this process and to apply for services online: <a href="http://sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu">sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu</a>. If you have already been approved for accommodations through SDAC, please send me your accommodation letter and meet with me so we can develop an implementation plan together.</p>
        <h2 id="ia-discrimination-and-power-based-violence">Discrimination and power-based violence</h2>
        <p>The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. To that end, it is vital that you know two values that I and the University hold as critically important:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Power-based personal violence will not be tolerated.</li>
            <li>Everyone has a responsibility to do their part to maintain a safe community on Grounds.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence website that describes reporting options and resources available - <a href="www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence">www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence</a>.</p>
        <p>As your professor and as a person, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as I can. As a faculty member, I am a responsible employee, which means that I am required by University policy and federal law to report what you tell me to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also reviewing the information presented to determine whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. If you wish to report something that you have seen, you can do so at the <strong>Just Report It</strong> portal (<a href="http://justreportit.virginia.edu/">http://justreportit.virginia.edu/</a>). <strong>The worst possible situation would be for you or your friend to remain silent when there are so many here willing and able to help.</strong></p>
        <h2 id="ia-religious-accommodations">Religious accommodations</h2>
        <p>It is the University's long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements.</p>
        <p>Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request in writing directly to me as far in advance as possible. Students who have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact the Universityâ€™s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) at <a href="mailto:UVAEOCR@virginia.edu">UVAEOCR@virginia.edu</a> or 434-924-3200.</p>
        <h2 id="ia-honor">Honor</h2>
        <p>I trust every student in this course to fully comply with all of the provisions of the Universityâ€™s Honor Code. By enrolling in this course, you have agreed to abide by and uphold the Honor System of the University of Virginia, as well as the following policies specific to this course.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All graded assignments must be pledged.</li>
            <li>All suspected violations will be forwarded to the Honor Committee, and you may, at my discretion, receive an immediate zero on that assignment regardless of any action taken by the Honor Committee.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please let me know if you have any questions regarding the course Honor policy. If you believe you may have committed an Honor Offense, you may wish to file a Conscientious Retraction by calling the Honor Offices at (434) 924-7602. For your retraction to be considered valid, it must, among other things, be filed with the Honor Committee before you are aware that the act in question has come under suspicion by anyone. More information can be found at <a href="http://honor.virginia.edu">http://honor.virginia.edu</a>. Your Honor representatives can be found at: <a href="http://honor.virginia.edu/representatives">http://honor.virginia.edu/representatives</a>.</p>
