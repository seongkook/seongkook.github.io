        <h1 id="pb-5">CS 6501: Topics in Human-Computer Interaction</h1>

        <p>Computers are now taking an essential part of our lives. We use computers in various forms for many tasks such as getting information, communicating with other people, ordering food, or you name it. Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research is about making the use of computers to be easier, more efficient, more effective, or more accessible. This graduate-level course will help you learn the basic concepts of HCI and how to conduct HCI research, with focuses on novel interaction methods and user interfaces.</p>
        <p>In this course, you are expected to do the followings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reading responses:</strong> All students will be expected to read the research papers that will be presented in the class and write a one-page response report before the class.
                Should include 1) summary of the paper and 2) your reaction to the paper. 
            </li>
            <li><strong>Topic presentation:</strong> Once a semester, each student will lead a class by summarizing papers and leading discussions on the topic.</li>
            <li><strong>Assignments:</strong> There will be two individual assignments.</li>
            <li><strong>Design Project:</strong> There is no better way of learning to conduct HCI research than actually doing one. Each team will 1) find a research topic on building an interactive system that solves a usability problem, 2) design and implement the system, and 3) evaluate the system. It is encouraged to connect your research to the course project.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="ia-course-material">Course Material</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>There is no official textbook, but <em>Human-Computer Interaction: An Empirical Research Perspective</em>, written by Scott Mackenzie can be very helpful.</li>
            <li>Selected papers from top HCI venues, including CHI, UIST, CSCW</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="ia-prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>There are no official prerequisites for this class, but you’ll need some programming skills for the design project.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="ia-prerequisites">Topic Presentation Guide</h2>
        <ul>
            <p>
            A student will lead a class by summarizing two papers and leading discussions on the topic. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>If you’re leading the class, </strong>
            <li> You’ll summarize two papers for 30 minutes (max 40 min). <br>
                    Summarize the goal of the papers and methods they used to achieve the goals. You don’t need to blend two papers when presenting. But have a moment that summarizes and compares two papers before or after explaining the two papers. 
            </li>
            <li> You’ll lead discussions for 10 - 20 minutes. Not just answering questions, you may lead discussions about its uses, limitations, or future directions.</li>
            <li> You don’t need to write a reading response for the week you’re presenting.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>If you're participating in the class, </strong>
            <li>
            Read the reading materials. While the leading student will present the paper, it’ll be hard for you to participate in a deep discussion if you haven’t read the papers. 
        </li>
        <li>Submit a reading response for the week. You will pick one of the four papers that will be presented in the next week and submit a reading response by Monday of the week the paper will be presented. </li>
        <li>Actively participate in the discussion. Discussion is a very important part of learning about a topic. Ask good questions and speak out your suggestions. </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        <h2 id="ia-prerequisites">Project Presentation/Report Guide</h2>
        <ul>

                Your design project will be graded based on your final presentation and final report. 
        </p>
        <p>            
            <li> Final Presentation: Dec 5</li>

        <h2 id="ia-students-with-disabilities-or-learning-needs">Students with disabilities or learning needs</h2>
        <p>It is my goal to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with me outside of class so we can explore potential options. Students with disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability Access Center to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this course, including official accommodations. Please visit their website for information on this process and to apply for services online: <a href="http://sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu">sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu</a>. If you have already been approved for accommodations through SDAC, please send me your accommodation letter and meet with me so we can develop an implementation plan together.</p>
        <h2 id="ia-discrimination-and-power-based-violence">Discrimination and power-based violence</h2>
        <p>The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. To that end, it is vital that you know two values that I and the University hold as critically important:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Power-based personal violence will not be tolerated.</li>
            <li>Everyone has a responsibility to do their part to maintain a safe community on Grounds.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence website that describes reporting options and resources available - <a href="www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence">www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence</a>.</p>
        <p>As your professor and as a person, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as I can. As a faculty member, I am a responsible employee, which means that I am required by University policy and federal law to report what you tell me to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also reviewing the information presented to determine whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. If you wish to report something that you have seen, you can do so at the <strong>Just Report It</strong> portal (<a href="http://justreportit.virginia.edu/">http://justreportit.virginia.edu/</a>). <strong>The worst possible situation would be for you or your friend to remain silent when there are so many here willing and able to help.</strong></p>
        <h2 id="ia-religious-accommodations">Religious accommodations</h2>
        <p>It is the University's long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements.</p>
        <p>Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request in writing directly to me as far in advance as possible. Students who have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact the University’s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) at <a href="mailto:UVAEOCR@virginia.edu">UVAEOCR@virginia.edu</a> or 434-924-3200.</p>
        <h2 id="ia-honor">Honor</h2>
        <p>I trust every student in this course to fully comply with all of the provisions of the University’s Honor Code. By enrolling in this course, you have agreed to abide by and uphold the Honor System of the University of Virginia, as well as the following policies specific to this course.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All graded assignments must be pledged.</li>
            <li>All suspected violations will be forwarded to the Honor Committee, and you may, at my discretion, receive an immediate zero on that assignment regardless of any action taken by the Honor Committee.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please let me know if you have any questions regarding the course Honor policy. If you believe you may have committed an Honor Offense, you may wish to file a Conscientious Retraction by calling the Honor Offices at (434) 924-7602. For your retraction to be considered valid, it must, among other things, be filed with the Honor Committee before you are aware that the act in question has come under suspicion by anyone. More information can be found at <a href="http://honor.virginia.edu">http://honor.virginia.edu</a>. Your Honor representatives can be found at: <a href="http://honor.virginia.edu/representatives">http://honor.virginia.edu/representatives</a>.</p>
